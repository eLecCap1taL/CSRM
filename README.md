## Welcome Horizon, the next generation of CSRM

## What's Horizon?
Horizon is a large-scale CS2 CFG project aimed at integrating and supporting all CS2 CFG functionalities while offering powerful customization options. It also features a custom radial radio, allowing players to visually access Horizon's functions in-game. Horizon is primarily designed for competitivee rules, meaning it operates under `sv_cheats 0`. However, it also includes some features that can be used in personal practicees.

In the future, with the Horizon CFG Manager, you'll be able to download and update your Horizon CFG online, with support for cross-version settings preservation. Additionally, features like custom automated props and quickifications to resources will be supported.

The ultimate goal of Horizon is to become the ONLY CFG you'll ever need for CS2. 👍

In most cases, using Horizon will not result in a VAC ban. It is simply a CFG project. 👍

## Some fun facts
> When you bhopping, the autostop can automatically turn off (Optional)

> You can use fakecheat, fastshift, auto-bhop, auto-attack and autostop at the same time. They can work together, and that will make you like a real cheater! XD

> You can use `SetPreAimOn` in AutoLineUp, then when you throwed a nade, you will be automatically set to another angle. This is useful when using bug flashes, but they are dead now :(
